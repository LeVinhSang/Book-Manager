use file .env to create Environment variables instead of host and user, password, name database.

Create a .env file in the root directory of your project. Add environment-specific variables on
new lines in the form of NAME=VALUE. For example:

DB_HOST=localhost     
DB_USER=root        
DB_PASS=s1mpl3   
DB_NAME=database
